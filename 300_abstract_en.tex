I can safely and without any doubt say that the work during my PhD research is the best since fire was first discovered.
Without the knowledge I have gained through my hard work and sleepless nights, all of humanity will go into the abyss.
Therefore, not only should everyone read this dissertation, the work hereby described should also be taught in every school as a basic knowledge.
