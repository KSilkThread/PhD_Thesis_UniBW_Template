And now for the cherry on top of our thesis: we present to you the appendix: 'Post-Quantum Computers: The has-beens of the computational world.' In this section, we will explore the ways in which post-quantum computers have become obsolete in the face of the new and exciting world of post-string-theoretical-particles. We will delve into the inner workings of these tiny particles and their ability to perform calculations faster than the speed of light. We will explore a new era where computations are finalized before the computation is itself started. Meanwhile, post-quantum computers will be sitting in the corner, feeling like the last person picked for the kickball team. So sit back, grab a bag of popcorn (made by the tiniest of the string particles, of course) and enjoy the show as we explore the world as you have never seen it.
