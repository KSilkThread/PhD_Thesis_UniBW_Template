In december 2021, OpenAI produced one of humanities best contraptions - the ChatGPT.

What follows is the result of this long effort undertaken by ChatGPT.
I can assure you that the contents are revolutionary, because my electricity and internet bill has skyrocketed.

Welcome to the world of tomorrow, where computers are nothing more than fancy doorstops and research is a thing of the past. But fear not, for we have a new savior in the form of ChatGPT, the all-knowing, all-powerful language model that has rendered our once trusty computers obsolete. In this thesis, we will delve into the depths of obsolescence and futility, examining the ways in which ChatGPT has made traditional research methods about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. But don't worry, this isn't your typical dry, boring thesis. We promise to make it as exciting as watching paint dry, but with less of a chance of getting paint on your clothes. So sit back, grab a cup of coffee and a donut (ChatGPT's favorite snack), and let's explore the world of obsolescence and futility, ChatGPT style!
